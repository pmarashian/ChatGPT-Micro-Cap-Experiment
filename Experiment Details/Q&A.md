## Q&A (Written July 26)

### Why did you remove DeepSeek after Week 1? Wouldn’t it be valuable to compare models?
I didn’t want to fully remove it at first. I considered feeding it stock reports and letting it trade off that. But that would’ve broken the core rule: the model has to find opportunities independently. If I start feeding it filtered ideas, it's no longer testing true AI-driven alpha.

### Why were you using R2K and XBI (BioTech EFT) as comparsions?
I intially only used Russell 2000, but I added XBI later after ChatGPT heavily leaned towards BioTech. Of course, looking back on it, it was a terrible idea to add metrics later. From now on, I will purely use the S&P 500 as that is the standard baseline for tests.
### Do you ever switch chats?
Yes. I wish I didn’t have to, but after ~2 weeks the performance slows down too much to be usable. I always keep chats organized in the same project and reintroduce prior theses when switching, though some changes are inevitable. It’s not perfect, but it keeps continuity.

### If you could start over, what would you do differently?
I’d make sure prompts are 100% consistent from the beginning and confirm the simulation engine was airtight before logging trades.

### What strengths or weaknesses have you noticed in the model?
**Strengths**: It’s incredible at finding overlooked data in obscure filings, especially biotech reports nobody reads. It also seems to great at capitalizing on short-term momentum.
**Weaknesses**: It often struggles with patience. It’s unclear if it can hold through the full timeline of a catalyst. And switching chats can cause it to lose conviction and restructure prematurely.

### Any plans after the 6 months?
If I can keep up during school, I might extend this idea into a full-year version.

### What return are you expecting by the end?
Originally, I expected 5–10%. But with the kind of asymmetric moves it’s hit so far, I think 25–30% isn’t out of the question, if it can manage risk well.

### Why are you using 4o? Doesn't ChatGPT have better models?
To be honest, I didn't think about it and just used the defult model. I may switch over to a more advanced one, but I will explictly state when and what model. 

### How do you ensure the limit orders get filled?
I mirror the trades in a real Vanguard brokerage account. If it executes there, I log the fill in the simulation.

### Could this actually be a real investing strategy?
It has serious potential. Most retail traders chase SPY predictions with random forests and fail. Real alpha hides in footnotes, obscure filings, and early-stage clinical data, files an LLM can parse in seconds. If combined with human oversight, this could potentially be a viable hybrid strategy. Of course, much more rigorous testing is needed.
