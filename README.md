ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment
Welcome to the repo behind my 6-month live trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a real-money micro-cap portfoliot.

# The Concept
Everyday, I kept seeing the same ad about having an A.I. pick stocks. 
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?".

So, tarting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

Can large language models like ChatGPT actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?

## Each trading day:

- I provide it trading data on the stocks in it's portfolio.

- Strict stop-loss rules apply.

- Everyweek I allow it to use deep research to reevaluate it's account.

- I track and publish both portfolios and performance data weekly on my blog.
